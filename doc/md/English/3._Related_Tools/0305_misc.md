# Miscellaneous Tools

## timvis scripts

Four scripts, `timvis.gmt4`, `/timvis.gmt5`, `timvis_abs.gmt4`, and
`/timvis_abs.gmt5`, are used to visualize the elapsed time of the
computation obtained with the input parameter `stopwatch_mode = .true.`
by using GMT versions 4 and 5.

## Geographic Coordinate Conversion

The Fortran programs `ll2xy.x` and `xy2ll.x` can project and inversely
project the geographic and Cartesian coordinates with the same algorithm
as `OpenSWPC`. These tools are provided for `OpenSWPC` version 3.0 or
later.
