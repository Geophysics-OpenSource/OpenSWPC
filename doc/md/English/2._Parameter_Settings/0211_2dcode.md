# About Two-Dimensional Codes

`OpenSWPC` contains P-SV (`swpc_psv`) and SH (`swpc_sh`) codes, which work
with the same parameter file. In these 2D codes, the simulation will be
performed along the $x--z$ cross section of $y=0$. The parameters
related to the $y$-direction will be omitted. The MPI partition will,
therefore, be 1D, only in the x-direction. Note that all stations and
sources outside the cross section will be projected onto the cross
section, as schematically shown in the next figure.

For plane wave incidence, `pw_strike` and `pw_rake` will be fixed according
to the type of code. Only the dip angle (`pw_dip`) can be changed.
